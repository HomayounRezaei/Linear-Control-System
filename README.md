1. Introduction
1.1. General Review
The system that will be studied in this project is a gimbal system. This system is one of the classical control systems. This system, due to being nonlinear and unstable, caused by external factors such as slipping on the ground and disturbances like mechanical vibration, can be suitable for analysis and design purposes. In this example, a gimbal system is considered, where a gimbal has been mounted on a lever, as shown in Figure 1. The gimbal is allowed to move freely on the lever with one degree of freedom. One end of the lever is connected to a servo motor controlled by the servo system. We define the angle ùúÉ as the angle of rotation of the lever. For example, for the tooth wheel of the servo motor, the ùúÉ angle changes the angle of the lever relative to the horizontal plane. Gravity causes the gimbal to move along the length of the lever, and as a result, the position of the gimbal and the lever's angle are connected to each other. The ultimate goal of this system is to connect the servo motor and the lever to a reference point. By controlling the system, we can keep the gimbal at a desired point on the lever, and the disturbances on the gimbal will not affect its external trajectory on the lever.
